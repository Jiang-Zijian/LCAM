# Long-Correlation-Associative-Memory models
The code for "Spectrum of non-Hermitian deep-Hebbian neural networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11411). In this paper we study an associative memory model considering temporal asymmetric and arbitrary wide synaptic plasticity window through random matrix theorem. Both numerical simulations of the networks and the numerical solutions of the random matrix equations can be found here.

# Requirements
python 3.9.12 (lower version may also ok)

# How to run
The code is organised into several ipynb files, corresponding to the figures in the main text. Please unzip "data.zip" before running.
